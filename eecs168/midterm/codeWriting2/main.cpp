/*
 Write a complete main.cpp to do the following:
 Create two arrays of characters based on sizes from the user
 (the arrays do not need to be the same size.
 Let the user fill each array with characters
 After the arrays are filled, you will swap as many values as possible between the arrays
 (remember, the arrays may be different sizes!) and print the updated arrays.
 
 Example:
 
 Arrays before the swap:                Arrays after the swap:
 array1: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]          array1: [x, y, z, d, e, f, g]
 array2: [x, y, z]                      array2: [a, b, c]
 
 After printing the message, ask the user if they want to exit.
 If they type an 'e' or 'E' then the program should exit, otherwise repeat the entire program until they want to exit.
