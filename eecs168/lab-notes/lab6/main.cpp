/*

These are the steps for Exercise 4 as multiple people have sent me questions about the exercise:

 You’ll have an “input.txt” file that contains a count of the number of values (5 in the example) followed by numbers  of type double. If the first value on the input.txt file is 5, then this will be followed by 5 values of type double. You will not prompt the user to enter these values. The values are given but the program should work with a different count and different values
Prompt the user for the file name
Read in the values from the input.txt file
Save the values into an array and create two files that you’ll write into, the normalized values of the array and the reversed values each in a separate text file named as “normalized.txt” and “reverse.txt” respectively
Check out the sample example on the wiki page to understand how a run of your program would look like
Nothing would be output to the console. But the only thing your program would do as you run it is write into the “normalized.txt” and “reversed.txt” files the normalized and reversed values of the array
