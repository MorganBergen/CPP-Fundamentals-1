Example Output:

Text #1:  New stack is empty: PASSED
Test #2:  Push on empty stack means it non-empty:  PASSES
Test #3:  Popping all elements makes stack empty:  PASSES
Test #4:  Copy Constructor copies all elements in correct order:  PASSES
Test #5:  Pushing an element after all elements have been popped makes the stack non-empty again:  PASSES
Test #6:  Popping all elements in two different instances still makes the stack empty:  PASSES
Test #7:  Popping an empty stack will not change the stack:  PASSED
Test #8:  Pushing multiple elements on a stack and peeking at that stack will always return the last element pushed:   PASSED
