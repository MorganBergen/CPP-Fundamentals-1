Boardwork4 Instructions

1.  	Define a Triangle class that implements the shape interface.
	/You will make the triangle.h and triangle.cpp file
	/Triangles have a base and height
	The required area method 
		/Declare our area method
	and a constructor that takes a base and height.
		/Declare constructor

2.	Assume you are in main.cpp
	Define a function that takes an array of Shape pointers and its size
	You will return a pointer to the shape with the largest area
	
	(main only deals with an array of shape pointers of type shape)
	
	//shape pointer

	Shapes* ptrShapesArr = new shapesArr[SIZE];

	This pointers can point to individual shapes
