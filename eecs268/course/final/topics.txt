EECS 268 Programming II
Fall 2021
Final Exam

When: 10:30am - 1:00pm Wednesday Dec 15th
Where:  Here


Format
- Conceptual
- Visualization
- Code writing

Topics
- Everything C++ related
- Midterm topics
- Recursion
	- Mimic a loop
	- recursive functions that return values
	- Factorial, Summation, Palindrome, use recursion to step throught the array
- Recursion with backtracking
	- N-Queens problem
	- Maze Walkng
	- Blob Lab
- Complexity
	- Space and time complexity
	- Big-O
	- Talk about the complexities of methods we've written
	- Sorts
		- Iterative Sorts:  Bubble, selection, inserstion
		- Recursive Sorts:  Quick sort, Merge sort
		- Compare and contrast
- Trees
	- Tree vocabulary (e.g. leaf, parent, child, subtree, root, left subtree, right subtree, 
- Binary Trees
	- Recall our binary tree exercises
	- Exhaustive search through traversal
	- Counting of the nodes
	- Traversal orders:  Pre, in, and post
	- In order traversal
	- Pre order traversal
	- Post order traversal
- Binary Search Trees 
	- Rules for adding values
	- Consequences of those rules (e.g. where the min value?)
	- Predicatable path to the minimum value or maximum value
	- Be competent in adding, searching, and removing from a Binary Search Tree
	- Two templated types within a data structure
- Heaps
	- Min heaps (and Max heaps, it's just a < vs > in terms of implementation)
	- Add to a heap (upheaping)
	- Remove from a heap (downheaping)
	- Array based implementation of array heaps
	- Recall index formulas for parent and child

Notes
- Boardworks, here is a problem and write code to solve that problem
- Stack First in last out
- Queues are Last in last out
- Bubble sort or selection sort
- Built alot of data structures
- I'm not going to make you code remove from scratch on the final
- Almost every exam question is in a modification of a boardwork
- Make sure to glance over a boardworks and past material covered
